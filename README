==Overview==
The sat_mod_ak python utility processes OMI retrieval data (as provided by NCEO RAL) and associated 
GEOS-Chem output (as generated by NCEO Edinburgh). It generates a NetCDF file with several fields relating to 
columns. Its most “sophisticated” product is the GEOS-Chem O3 column with OMI averaging kernals and priors 
applied. For normal operation, the user should only need to edit the associated options file, options_sat_mod_ak, 
before executing the utility.

==Dependencies== 
This utility runs in python. Most modules used are fairly common, with the exception of bpch, used to read the 
binary punch GEOS-Chem files. This is a deprecated module: https://github.com/barronh/bpch. The binary format is 
likely to be deprecated soon in GEOS-Chem, in which case it will be required to update to read NetCDF here.

==Inputs==
OMI Data: This utility reads L3 OMI retrieval data from IDL sav files. Data can be in either daily or monthly-average 
formats. The format of these needs to be quite precise. Monthly data is assumed to be in YYYY sub-folders, and daily 
data in YYYYMM subfolders of a parent folder.

GEOS-Chem Output: This utility was developed for compatibility with version 11 of GEOS-Chem. The associated GEOS-Chem 
output must be in the ND51 output in binary punch format. Files are daily and must include species mixing ratios, 
as well as the fields “BXHGHT-$_BXHEIGHT”, “TIME-SER_AIRDEN” and “PEDGE-$_PSURF”.

==Options==
This utlity reads in options that may be edited in the subroutine get_options of options_sat_mod_ak. These are 
generally explained in comments in that file. When executing the script, the validity of the options will be first 
checked, and the user is alerted to errors.
