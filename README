==Overview==
Sat_mod_ak is a python utility for processing satellite retrieval data (as provided by NCEO RAL) and associated GEOS-Chem output (as generated by NCEO Edinburgh). It generates a NetCDF file with several fields relating to columns. A separate script has been made to make plots from this. Its most “sophisticated” product is the GEOS-Chem O3 column with satellite averaging kernals and priors applied. For normal operation, the user should only need to edit the associated options file, options_sat_mod_ak, before executing the utility.

==Dependancies==
The script runs in python. Most modules used are fairly common, with the exception of bpch, used to read the binary punch GEOS-Chem files. This is a deprecated module: https://github.com/barronh/bpch. The binary format is likely to be deprecated soon in GEOS-Chem, in which case it will be required to update to read NetCDF here.

==Inputs==
Satellite data: The script reads level 3 retrieval data from IDL sav files. Data can be in either daily or monthly-average formats. The format of these needs to be quite precise. Monthly data is assumed to be in YYYY sub-folders, and daily data in YYYYMM subfolders of a parent folder. Currently supported instruments and retrieval versions:
OMI -> fv0214, fv0214_xc and fv0300_xc
GOME-2A -> fv0300 only

GEOS-Chem output: The associated GEOS-Chem data is the ND51 output in binary punch format. The script was developed for version 11 of GEOS-Chem. Files are daily. This needs to include the mixing ratio of species, as well as the fields “BXHGHT-$_BXHEIGHT”, “TIME-SER_AIRDEN” and “PEDGE-$_PSURF”.

==Options==
The user edits options in the subroutine get_options of options_sat_mod_ak. These are generally explained in comments in that file. When executing the script, the validity of the options will be first checked, and the user is alerted to errors.
